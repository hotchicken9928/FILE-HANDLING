This is a basic C program made for file handling operations.

The program can do the following:
1. Create a new file
2. Write data into the file (overwrites existing)
3. Append more data to the file
4. Read and display contents of the file

The user is asked to enter the filename and then select the operation from the menu.
This project shows how to use file-related functions like fopen, fclose, fputs, fgetc etc.
It is useful to understand basic file concepts in C language.
